Description: CaMutQC is able to filter false positive mutations generated due to 
    technical issues, as well as to select candidate cancer mutations through a 
    series of well-structured functions by labeling mutations with various flags.
    And a detailed and vivid filter report will be offered after completing 
    a whole filtration or selection section. Also, CaMutQC integrates serveral 
    methods and gene panels for Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)calculation.
